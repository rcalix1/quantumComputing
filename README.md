## Concepts

* They operate on Quantum bits (qubits), which can be both 0 and 1 simultaneously (a state called superposition).
* The idea is that they work because of "entanglement". Two particles can be entangled in a way that observing the value of one, reveals the value of the other (regardless of distance).
